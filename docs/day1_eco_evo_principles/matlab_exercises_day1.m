%% Simulate a viral invasion - SV lytic model

%% TO BE DONE LATER

% This script demonstrates the function $\sin(x)$ and its LaTeX rendering.
% Consider the SV model for lytic infections with susceptible cells (S) and free viruses (V) given by,
% $$ \dot{S} = bS $$
% $$ \dot{S} = bS $$

S = 1:3;
plot(S,S,'-ro');
