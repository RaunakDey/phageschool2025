**Phage transform the fate of cells, populations, and ecosystems.**  
Building on the interdisciplinary QLife workshops in Paris (2022 & 2024), this summer school brings together researchers integrating models, experiments, and field data to explore the rich dynamics of phage–bacteria interactions across biological scales.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
Participants will:
- Learn fundamental and cutting-edge methods in phage–bacteria modeling
- Explore mechanisms in spatial dynamics, phage therapy, evolution, and ecosystem functioning
- Work with real data through computational labs and problem-solving exercises
- Bridge models with empirical data using Python or R

---

### 📅 Daily Schedule Highlights
- ☀️ **Morning** — Lectures by leading experts
- 🖥️ **Afternoon** — Hands-on computational labs
- 🌙 **Evening** — Plenary talks or poster sessions
